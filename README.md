# Fire Detection Using YOLO

This project presents a real-time fire detection system using the YOLOv8 deep learning model. The goal is to provide an intelligent and responsive solution to identify fire in video streams and camera feeds. By leveraging the power of deep learning and computer vision, this system is designed to help in the early detection of fires, which can play a critical role in preventing disasters and protecting both lives and infrastructure.

## Overview

Fires can spread rapidly and cause catastrophic damage if not identified early. Traditional fire detection systems like smoke detectors or thermal sensors may have limitations in outdoor environments, large facilities, or industrial settings. This project aims to enhance fire safety mechanisms by using a visual detection method that operates in real-time.

By training a YOLOv8 object detection model on a custom fire dataset, we achieve a solution capable of detecting fire from webcam input or pre-recorded video files. This approach enables timely alerts and automation in fire response systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for scripting the model and processing video frames  
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)**: State-of-the-art real-time object detection model used for training and inference  
- **OpenCV**: Used for handling video input and drawing visualizations  
- **cvzone**: Simplifies the process of displaying bounding boxes and labels  
- **Tkinter (optional)**: Used to select video files if needed  

## Installation and Setup

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OswinBijuChacko/Fire-Detection-USing-YOLO.git
cd Fire-Detection-USing-YOLO
```

### Install the required Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Ensure that `best.pt` (the trained model) is available in the root directory

If not, download or train your own model using the steps below.

## Running Fire Detection

### From Webcam

```bash
python fire.py
```

### From Video File

Edit `fire.py`:

```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('input.mp4')
```

## Training the Model

If you wish to train the fire detection model from scratch or on your own dataset:

1. Organize your dataset in YOLO format with `images/` and `labels/` directories  
2. Modify the `fire.yaml` file to correctly point to the dataset paths and specify the number of classes (in this case, 1: `fire`)  
3. Use the training notebook (`train.ipynb`) or run the following script:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  # or yolov8s.pt depending on your desired model size
model.train(data="fire.yaml", epochs=50)
```

After training, the best-performing model weights will be saved as `best.pt`.
